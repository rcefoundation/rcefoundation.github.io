							<h2>About the Foundation</h2>
							<p>The first random chimp event occured on 19-1-2009, and its unprofessional cover-up by the government led to the immediate formation of the Anti-Chimp Council. However, the events unpredictably stopped occuring, and the Council was soon dissolved.</p>
							<p>However, a resurgence of Random Chimp Events on 17-02-2020 has convinced the Council Elders to re-activate the Council under a new name, the Random Chimp Event Foundation.</p>
							<p>The aim of the Foundation is to keep mankind informed of the threat of the Events and prevent any further Event from occuring.</p>

						<h3>The very first Random Chimp Event</h3>
						<p>This Random Chimp Event took place on 19-1-2009. Because the government was so unprofessional when covering up the mess the Chimps made, out SpecOps Stealth Operating Operatives were able to gather many details.</p>
						<p>At 11:00 exactly, a sole Chimp entered the Marcy Projects hallway, exiting a few minutes later carrying multiple bags which carried stolen valuables, including cash, jewellery and even TV cameras. When we asked the many eyewitnesses inside what happened, all of them had the same story, depicted below (ACTUAL TESTIMONY):<br><br>"So we were enjoying the 2009 World Series of Dice and things were actually going good, no robberies, everyone was happy, when this weird chimp came in, started to shoot at the ceiling and yelling like all them apes do. It stole everything we had, cash, rings, even the producers cameras. It even shot one of the contestants for their money! Damn!" </p>
						<h3>The Resurgence</h3>
						<p>In late January of 2020, an Instagram account ("randomchimpevent") was created, posting so-called "internet memes" about the random chimp events. Later, in February, subreddit r/okbuddyretard experienced the same phenomenon. These people have found out the truth about the Events through us! Open your eyes! The truth about the Random Chimp Events is all around you! Don't listen to the government, listen to us! There are several REAL, VERIFIED pictures of these Events happening!</p>
